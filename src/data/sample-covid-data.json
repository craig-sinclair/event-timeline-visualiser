International public-health bodies began preliminary case investigations and contact tracing; sequencing and epidemiological work that followed identified a novel coronavirus (later named SARS-CoV-2). Early reports emphasised a cluster linked to a seafood/animal market but investigations continued into transmission chains, case definitions and clinical presentation. This notification set in motion global surveillance and the rapid scientific response that followed in January 2020.",
