The Act also created the independent Climate Change Committee to advise the government and monitor progress. This groundbreaking legislation set a template for climate action globally and established the UK as an international leader on climate policy.",

The carbon price floor is credited as one of the most effective policies in driving the UK's dramatic reduction in coal use.

Homeowners could claim vouchers covering up to two-thirds of costs (up to £5,000), with low-income households eligible for 100% funding (up to £10,000). However, the scheme was plagued by bureaucratic delays, difficulties finding approved installers, and low awareness. It was abruptly scrapped in March 2021 after just six months, with only £314 million of the £2 billion allocated actually spent—just 5% of the budget reaching households. The failure was widely criticized as emblematic of stop-start climate policies that undermine industry confidence and waste public money. It highlighted the challenge of retrofitting the UK's poorly insulated housing stock.",

Johnson declared the UK would become the 'Saudi Arabia of wind', positioning offshore wind as central to both decarbonization and economic recovery from COVID-19. The plan included £160 million to upgrade ports and infrastructure for offshore wind manufacturing. The UK's shallow seas, particularly in the North Sea, provide ideal conditions for offshore wind, and the country has become a global leader in the technology. The commitment represented significant ambition, though some questioned whether grid infrastructure, planning systems, and supply chains could scale at the required pace.",

The funding recognized that charging infrastructure is critical to supporting the planned ban on new petrol and diesel car sales from 2030 (later delayed to 2035). The UK has led Europe in EV adoption, with over 1 million EVs on the road by 2022, but 'charging anxiety' remains a barrier.
